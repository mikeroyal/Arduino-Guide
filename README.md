## Arduino Tools

[Back to the Top](https://github.com/mikeroyal/arduino-Guide/blob/main/README.md#table-of-contents)
 
[Arduino CLI](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli) is an all-in-one solution that provides builder, Boards/Library Manager, uploader, discovery and many other tools needed to use any Arduino compatible board and platforms.
 
[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) is an open source integrated development environment(IDE) for the Arduino computing platforms based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
 
[Arduino Pro IDE](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-pro-ide) is a professional version of the Arduino IDE that brings more features for advanced users and developers. The project is currently in the experimently version.

[VSCode Arduino](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-arduino) is a VSCode extension for Arduino.  The Arduino extension makes it easy to develop, build, deploy and debug your Arduino sketches in Visual Studio Code, with a rich set of functionalities. 
 
[Gobot](https://gobot.io/) is a framework using the [Golang](https://golang.org/)  programming language for robotics, physical computing, and the Internet of Things(IoT).
 
[Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs) is an alternative firmware for [ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) based devices with easy configuration using webUI, OTA updates, automation using timers or rules, expandability and entirely local control over MQTT, HTTP, Serial or KNX.
 
[Blynk](https://www.blynk.cc/) is a C++ library for embedded hardware. It works with over 400 hardware models such as Arduino, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi, Intel Edison/Galileo, LinkIt ONE, Particle Core/Photon, ARM mbed, etc.
 
[Arduino Thread](https://github.com/ivanseidel/ArduinoThread) is a library tha makes it simple to run Threads on Arduino.
