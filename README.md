## Resources
 
[FPGA(Field Programmable Gate Arrays)](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/fpga/what-is-an-fpga.html) are semiconductor devices that are based around a matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) connected via programmable interconnects. FPGAs can be reprogrammed to desired application or functionality requirements after manufacturing.

[TinyFPGA](https://tinyfpga.com) is a new series of boards that are low-cost, [open source FPGA boards](https://github.com/tinyfpga) in a tiny form factor.
